j01-042,"Unless it is known at what oxygen potential a given material in the sodium coolant circuit will start to oxidise the cell can only be used as has been suggested above , as an oxygen concentration monitor . oxygen potential the reference electrode could be held at that potential and oxidizing or reducing conditions in the coolant circuit for that material would be"
j01-045,"Thus for the specific case of niobium in a sodium circuit a corrosion indicator could be a reference electrode of sodium saturated and equilibrated with niobium separated from the coolant by a solid anionic electrolyte . A negative voltage from conditions for niobium and positive voltage , non- oxidizing conditions . The practical application of the above idea will involve considerable experimenta- tion before it can be realised ."
j01-049,"The first requirement is for an anionic electrolyte , which can be fabricated into suitable shapes impervious to gases and liquid sodium and which is neither corroded by sodium nor by sodium monoxide . Possible materials are zirconia stabilised with lime and thoria doped with rare earth oxides ."
j01-059,"Provided the temperatures at C and E are the same , thermoelectric contributions to the voltage should be zero . The probe extends out of the sodium stream through a close fitting thin walled T-Junction F and passes into the open via a water-cooled O ring seal G . The open end of the probe is sealed with a vacuum coupling H which also positions the +ve nickel conductor with respect to the sodium by circlips on either side of the seal I ."
j01-063,minimised by a close fitting cylindrical block of electrolyte J attached to the +ve nickel conductor by nickel circlips . Fixing and positioning of the probe relative to the coolant material K joining the vacuum coupling H to the water cooled flange G .
j01-066,"The probe can be evacuated and filled with inert gas via the tube L which must of course be electrically isolated after this has been carried out . It is not the inadequacy of some simpler method of monitoring the oxygen in a sodium circuit . The principal difficulty encountered by the author , in determining partial molal free energies by solid electrolyte cells of very stable oxides such as UO2 , MnO etc. was vapour phase transfer of oxygen by"
j01-070,This resulted in the oxidation of the -ve electrode and reduction of the +ve electrode which of course led to a loss in E.M.F. from the cell . In the above design the two electrodes are completely separated from one trouble should not be present .
j04-008,"The presence of 75 of bismuth-210 is equivalent to after a further forty days , the bismuth daughter than forty or fifty days after preparation , the lead-210 together with added lead carrier must be separated from the bismuth-210 daughter by before precipitating lead chromate ."
j04-012,"Knowing the time of separation and the absolute activity of the reference standards can be calculated from the known activity of the lead-210 solution and the chemical yield , but this calculation is unnecessary provided the same lead carrier solution is used to prepare the reference standards"
j04-015,Only the weights of the recovered lead chromate precipitates need be known because the concentration of the lead carrier solution cancels out of the algebraic equations . An effort was made to detect the presence of any radioactive impurities in bismuth-210 by anion exchange . The 15b-counting minutes of completing the separation .
j04-019,The ingrowth of bismuth-210 was followed for ten days and showed no abnormalities . Any impurity in the lead fraction must ha- ve been well below one percent . Some separa- dards and as a tracer in recovery experiments . There was no significant difference between the- se results and those obtained using the original lead-210 solution supplied by the Radiochemical Centre which we concluded was radiochemi- cally pure .
j04-024,"lead can be isolated from large volumes of solu- tion by coprecipitating the lead with a strontium sulphate . Lead and strontium form mixed cry- stals so that the more insoluble lead sulphate is almost completely recovered even if precipitation of the strontium sulphate is incomplete . Using ten milligrams of lead carrier and six hundred milligrams of strontium per liter , more than 95 experiment ."
j04-035,Absorption of the beta particles is also kept to a minimum but the accuracy and precision of weighing the precipitated sources suffers . All precipitates were weighed on a semi-micro balance which had been calibrated with a set of certificated weights from the National Physical Laboratory . Complete chemical exchange between the radio-lead and the added lead carrier is necessary if the analytical results are to be correct .
j04-039,"In the preliminary experiments , the tracer was added to a liter of effluent and immediately coprecipitated with strontium sulphate from hot solution . Chemical exchange was added to alkaline effluent and allowed to stand for several days before the addition of lead carrier , the recovery of lead-210 was as much as five per cent low when corrected for gravimetric recovery of the carrier ."
j04-046,The presence and growth of algae in the alkaline effluent does not prevent the recovery of radio-lead under the prescribed conditions although some radioactivity remains on the algae until the metathesis has been completed by heating the mixed sulphates with three separate portions of dilute ( 1.25 normal ) sodium carbonate solution . The strength of the carbonate solution was chosen after experiments with lead tracer alone which indicated that less lead was
j04-053,A small manual coffee grinder is useful as the resin cannot be ground with a mortar and pestle . The sieved resin is washed repeatedly with distilled water to remove fines and then with hydrochloric acid to convert the resin completely to the chloride form . The 60-100 mesh resin is again washed with water to remove the acid and finally dried in air .
j04-061,The glass tube is 11 cm. long and 1 cm. in internal diameter . One end of the tube is drawn down to a fine tip and a B14 conical glass socket is fitted to the other end as shown in Figure 1 . The reservoir is a 50 ml cylindrical separating funnel with a capillary tap modified by the addition of a B14 cone to fit the glass column .
j04-065,"The exact volume of the eluting agents must be found by experiment for each batch of resin using radioactive tracer Figure 3 . Once these volumes have been established , the weight of resin used is also fixed . All available evidence indicates that the fractions containing lead and bismuth are free ingrowth of the daughters arising from the decay of"
j04-070,"Polonium-210 remains on the column and does not and therefore passes through in the feed solution and the first wash . The resin is used for a single separation and then thrown away . In the first stage of the analysis , only the fraction containing counting tray , dried under an infra-red lamp , weighed , and set aside for five days while the bismuth-210 grows in ."
j04-076,"At the end of five days , bismuth-210 will have reached one-half of its equilibrium value and can be counted through an aluminium absorber sufficiently thick to stop the beta particles from lead-210 and the alpha particles from polonium-210 ."
j04-080,distorted if activity other than bismuth- 210 is present . These bismuth nuclides may include : together with their lead parents . All but lead-212 will decay completely within six hours . The decay of lead-212 will distort the observed activity for hour and a half days if it is present .
j04-094,"If there is sufficient beta activity , the radioche- by observing the decay curve . The removal of lead chromate from the aluminium counting tray together with the bismuth-210 prior to the second ion exchange separation has been checked by counting the trays . Not more than 0.2 of the"

The completeness of the chemical exchange between the bismuth-210 and the added carrier was lead chromate ( lead-210 , bismuth-210 ) were counted and dissolved in nitric acid in silica basins . The contents were evaporated to dryness with"
j04-103,The bismuth was recovered from the eluate as the phosphate . Results did not differ from those obtained by the more convenient method of heating the dissolved chro- mates in 2 N hydrochloric acid for fifteen minutes . The more rigorous method of securing chemical exchange was unnecessary . only at very low concentrations .
j04-111,"Table 1 shows the decontamination factors obtained experimentally for ten radionuclides , accompanied in two instances by radioactive dau- ghters . The decontamination factor falls below 104 only for Ruthenium-106 and zirconium-95 with their daughters in the first stage , i.e. 21 daughter . When the second stage ( the bismuth phosphate source ) is completed , the decontami-"
j04-115,A known quantity ( approx. 1 x 10-2 15mc ) of lead-210 was added to 1-litre aliquots of different batches of typical low-activity effluent . The aliquots were allowed to where noted to the contrary ) before lead carrier was added and the analytical procedure begun .
j06-000,"All stages of Calanus , for example , seem to migrate on some occasions while any stage may not on others . Such data cannot yet be rationalized . Where information is less extensive , however , it is possible to find some regularity in the observations . Thus in Euphausia superba from the Antarctic , the metanauplii remain in deep water , the later larval stages migrate diurnally , and the adolescents stay permanently at the surface ."
j06-005,"The migrating stages all come from 100-250 meters , and the time of their arrival at the surface is directly related to their swimming capacity : 3rd ( oldest ) calyptopis from 1800-2200 hr ; 2nd , from 2200-0200 hr ; and 1st , from 0200-0600 hr . Similar ontogenetic differences are apparent in Bosmina coregoni whose adults remain at the surface while the young migrate to and from a depth of 50 meters ."
j06-008,"Such permanent occurrence at the surface could of course be considered the extreme of a variable day depth . The effect of day depths upon the surfacing of various animals has been reviewed elsewhere . c . of migrational behavior , some kinds Vertical movement occurs in some forms that commonly met ."
j06-014,"Such reversed migrations are known for Acartia clausi , A. longiremis , Nyctiphanes couchii , Evadne sp. , Oithona nana , Daphnia lumholzi , Stages 4 , 5 , and adult of Calanus finmarchicus , Diaptomus banforanus , and Cyclops bicuspidatus . An echo-producing layer , which the authors think probably consists of euphausiids , has also been described as , in part , regularly moving in a reverse manner . Most of these records are well substantiated and involve whole populations rather than aberrant individuals ."
j06-018,"But normal movements have been reported also for the same species in the case of five of these examples and for other species in the same genera for the remaining Evadne , forms sometimes migrate and on other occasions do not , but a few appear to remain permanently at one level . Considering the widespread incidence of migration in the"
j06-022,"The most clearly substantiated case is that of the copepod Anomalocera at the surface . Among other copepods Rhincalanus gigas , Calanoides acutus , reported as showing no migration . The predaceous cladoceran Bythotrephes longimanus also remains at one"
j06-026,"In view of its well-known normal migration , the occurrence of Calanus finmarchicus in the summer at the surface in bright sunlight may justly be considered anomalous . This phenomenon has nevertheless been recorded many times , and such surface Calanus may be present in enormous numbers , breaking the surface"
j06-030,It seems likely that a continuous interchange was taking place between the population at the surface and that in deeper water . A second group whose normal vertical migration is sufficiently well known to make daytime occurrence at the surface rank as anomalous is the Euphausiacea . There are numerous records of euphausiids swimming

j06-051,"Downward movement may in some forms start as a passive sinking , especially when it occurs before dawn ; but this must almost certainly be replaced by the headfirst downward swimming observed in the field . 3 . Initiating , primary dependence of diurnal migrations upon changes in light intensity is beyond doubt . Yet in spite"
j06-056,"Loeb first suggested the importance of light as the governing factor but combined its influence with that of gravity . Later authors , in particular Rose , have proposed that light alone can provide an adequate mechanism if the animals have , and select by exploration , a with a suggestion that both"
j07-000,"This resulted in units of much lighter weight than could be obtained with tubular constructions . The growth of the aircraft industry brought even greater emphasis to the need for lightweight compact heat exchangers . During the 1930's , the secondary surface plate-and-corrugation construction became established for aero-engine radiators , using dip-soldered copper . The air and engine-coolant passages were separated by flat plates ."
j07-005,"The air passages were packed with corrugated provide the necessary surface area for heat transfer . The narrower coolant passages were also packed with foil ,"
j07-009,"This development coincided with the introduction of pressurized aircraft cabins and the demand for air-to-air cabin coolers . Although in this case the heat transfer coefficients on the two sides of the heat exchanger were of comparable magnitude , the use of secondary surface was still attractive , since the greater part of the surface area could be made up of fins only 0.006 in. ( 0.15 mm. ) thick ."
j07-012,"the fins made possible a reduction in the total surface area required as compared with the use of smooth continuous passages for the same thermal duty and pressure losses . The properties of compact form , low weight , and design flexibility thus developed found ready application on a much larger scale with the introduction of tonnage scale air separation plants ."
j07-015,The basic method of construction is both simple and extremely flexible . Figure 3 illustrates the arrangement of a single passage . This can be manufacturing equipment available . The corrugation of uniformity in height and fin pitch .
